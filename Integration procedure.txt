Language can be used to integrate smart contracts with websites => Python, Javascript

Web3 libraries can be used to integrate smart contracts with websites => Web3.py, Web3.JS, Ethers.JS, Web3Wallet, Wagmi, etc.

Front-end Framework can be used to integrate smart contracts with websites => NextJS, ReactJS, Basic HTML, VueJS, etc.

Wallets can be used to integrate smart contracts with websites => Metamask, WalletConnect, etc.


My Suggestion =>
1. Javascript has more flexibility and a wide range of libraries.
2. Wagmi is best with the WalletConnect modal.
3. NextJS is better,
4. The user will be able to connect any wallet the user wants if we integrate WalletConnect.

Example of sending a transaction in the blockchain/smart contract using EthersJS and Basic HTML:

async function addToCommunity() {
console.log(`adding to the community...`)
if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", [])
const signer = provider.getSigner()
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer)
try {
const transactionResponse = await contract.addToCommunity("0x6663184b3521bf1896ba6e1e776ab94c317204b6")
await listenForTransactionMine(transactionResponse, provider)
// await transactionResponse.wait(1)
} catch (error) {
console.log(error)
}
} else {
withdrawButton.innerHTML = "Please install MetaMask"
}
}

Example of reading from the blockchain/smart contract using EthersJS and Basic HTML:

async function getCurrentMemberId() {
if (typeof window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
const signer = provider.getSigner()
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer)
try {
const id= await contract.getCurrentMemberId()

} catch (error) {
console.log(error)
}
} else {
balanceButton.innerHTML = "Please install MetaMask"
}
}

Example of sending a transaction in the blockchain/smart contract using Wagmi and NextJS:

const addToCommunity= async (
) => {
try {
const account = getAccount();
const args = [URL];
const config = await prepareWriteContract({
address: contractAddress,
abi: contractABI,
functionName: "addToCommunity",
args: "0x6663184b3521bf1896ba6e1e776ab94c317204b6",
chainId: expectedChainId,
account: account,
});
const { hash } = await writeContract(config);
const data = await waitForTransaction({
confirmations: 1,
chainId: expectedChainId,
hash: hash,
});
console.log(data);
} catch (error) {
console.log(error);
}
};

Example of reading from the blockchain/smart contract using Wagmi and NextJS:
const getCurrentMemberId= async (user) => {
try {
const args = [user];
const data = await readContract({
address: contractAddress,
abi: contractABI,
functionName: "getCurrentMemberId",
args:[],
chainId: expectedChainId,
});
return data;
} catch (error) {
console.log(error);
}
};

Steps to initiate the TandaPay Logic:

1. The secretary needs to add at least 12 members to the community.
2. The secretary needs to create at least 3 Subgroups.
3. The secretary needs to assign at least 12 members to the 3 SubGroups including at least 4 members on each SubGroup.
4. The next step for the secretary is to call the initiatDefaultStateAndSetCoverage function to set up the coverage and move the community state to Default from the Initialization. After that, the members will be able to join the community by calling the joinToCommunity function.
5. Now, the secretary can initiate the first period by calling the AdvanceToTheNextPeriod function. And the TandaPay project logic will start working even though, no one can submit a claim in the first period as they haven't paid the previous period.
